# Creating Your First Azure Virtual Machine

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating your very first Azure Virtual Machine (VM). Virtual Machines are the building blocks of cloud computing, allowing you to run applications and workloads in a scalable and efficient manner.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active Azure account (if not, refer to the [Setting Up Your Azure Account](AzureAccountSetup.md) tutorial)
- Access to the Azure portal

## Steps to Create Your First Azure Virtual Machine

### 1. Sign in to the Azure Portal

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Sign in using your Azure account credentials.

### 2. Create a New Virtual Machine

1. On the Azure portal dashboard, click "Create a resource."
2. Search for "Windows Server" or "Linux" depending on your preference.
3. Select the desired OS image and click "Create."

### 3. Configure the Virtual Machine

1. Provide a unique name for your VM.
2. Choose a region and availability options.
3. Select the appropriate size for your VM based on your workload needs.
4. Configure administrative credentials for remote access.
5. Choose networking options, including virtual network and subnet settings.
6. Configure optional features like monitoring and diagnostics.

### 4. Review and Create

1. Review your VM configuration settings.
2. Click "Create" to provision the virtual machine.

### 5. Access Your Virtual Machine

1. Once the VM is created, you can find it on the Azure portal dashboard.
2. Click on the VM to access its overview page.
3. From the overview page, you can find options to connect to the VM using Remote Desktop (for Windows) or SSH (for Linux).

## Why Create Your First Azure Virtual Machine?

Creating your first Azure Virtual Machine is an essential step in understanding how to leverage cloud resources for your applications. It introduces you to fundamental concepts like VM provisioning, configuration, and remote access, which are valuable skills for cloud deployment.
