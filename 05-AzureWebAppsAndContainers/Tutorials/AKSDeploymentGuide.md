# Tutorial: Deploying Applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of deploying your applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), leveraging the power of Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing your containerized workloads. By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an AKS cluster, deploy containerized applications, and manage scaling and updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- An active Azure account
- Docker installed on your local machine for containerization
- A Docker image of your application hosted in a container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry)

## Setting Up an AKS Cluster

### Creating an AKS Cluster Using Azure Portal

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal.
2. Create a new AKS cluster, specifying details like region, node pool size, and Kubernetes version.
3. Configure authentication, network settings, and monitoring options.

### Creating an AKS Cluster Using Azure CLI

1. Open the Azure CLI.
2. Use the `az aks create` command to create an AKS cluster, providing necessary parameters.

## Deploying Your Application to AKS

### Preparing Your Application

1. Containerize your application using Docker, and create a Docker image.
2. Push your Docker image to a container registry like Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### Deploying Using `kubectl`

1. Configure `kubectl` to connect to your AKS cluster.
2. Create a Kubernetes deployment manifest for your application.
3. Use `kubectl apply` to apply the deployment manifest and create pods.

## Scaling and Updating Your Application

### Scaling Pods

1. Update the desired replica count in your deployment manifest to scale pods.

### Updating Your Application

1. Make changes to your application code and create a new Docker image.
2. Update the container image tag in your deployment manifest.
3. Apply the updated manifest using `kubectl apply` to trigger a rolling update.

## Conclusion

> Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), gaining hands-on experience with container orchestration using Kubernetes. By creating an AKS cluster, deploying applications, and managing scaling and updates, you're now equipped to leverage AKS for efficient and scalable containerized application deployment.

Orchestrate with confidence, innovate with AKS!
