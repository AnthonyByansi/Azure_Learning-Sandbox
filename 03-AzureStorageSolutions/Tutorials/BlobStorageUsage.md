# Using Azure Blob Storage for Data Storage

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to effectively use Azure Blob Storage to store and manage various types of unstructured data. Azure Blob Storage is a versatile solution that enables you to store anything from images and videos to backups and documents. By following this tutorial, you'll gain hands-on experience in uploading, retrieving, and managing blobs within an Azure Storage account.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An active Azure account
- Access to the Azure portal

## Steps to Use Azure Blob Storage

### 1. Sign in to the Azure Portal

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Sign in using your Azure account credentials.

### 2. Create an Azure Storage Account

1. On the Azure portal dashboard, click "Create a resource."
2. Search for "Storage account" and select "Storage account" from the search results.
3. Configure the storage account settings, such as name, region, and performance options.

### 3. Create a Blob Container

1. Access your newly created Azure Storage account.
2. Navigate to the "Containers" section and create a new container.
3. Define the container's properties, such as name and access level.

### 4. Upload Blobs to the Container

1. Select the created container and navigate to the "Upload" option.
2. Choose the type of blob you want to upload (Block Blob, Page Blob, or Append Blob).
3. Upload your desired data files to the container.

### 5. Retrieve and Manage Blobs

1. Access the Azure Storage account and navigate to the container with your uploaded blobs.
2. Explore the options to download, copy, or delete blobs as needed.

### 6. Implement Access Control (Optional)

1. Configure Shared Access Signatures (SAS) to provide controlled access to specific blobs or containers.
2. Experiment with role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions at a granular level.

## Benefits and Use Cases

- **Media Storage**: Use Azure Blob Storage to store and serve media files, such as images and videos, for your applications.

- **Backup and Recovery**: Store backup data securely in Blob Storage, ensuring data durability and easy retrieval.

- **Data Archiving**: Leverage Blob Storage to archive historical data that needs to be retained for compliance or analysis.
