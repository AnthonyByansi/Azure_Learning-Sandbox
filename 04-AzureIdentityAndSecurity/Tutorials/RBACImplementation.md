# Tutorial: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure, allowing you to control access to your resources based on specific roles. By following this tutorial, you'll learn how to assign roles, manage permissions, and ensure that users have appropriate access to resources within your cloud environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- An active Azure account
- Resources in your Azure subscription that you want to manage access for

## Implementing Role-Based Access Control

### Assigning Built-in Roles

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to the resource you want to manage access for.
3. Under "Access control (IAM)," add a new role assignment.
4. Select a built-in role (e.g., Contributor, Reader, Owner) and specify the user or group.

### Creating Custom Roles

1. Access the Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" and create a custom role.
3. Define the permissions for the custom role by specifying actions and resources.
4. Assign the custom role to users or groups within specific scopes.

### Testing Access

1. Sign in as the assigned user.
2. Verify that the user can perform actions aligned with their assigned role.

## Benefits and Use Cases

- **Granular Access Control**: RBAC enables you to grant specific permissions to users based on their roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Resource Segmentation**: Assign roles at different levels (subscription, resource group, resource) to segment access control.

- **Delegated Management**: Empower different teams to manage their resources without granting excessive permissions.

## Conclusion

> Congratulations! You've successfully implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure, enhancing your ability to manage and control access to your resources. By assigning roles, specifying permissions, and testing access, you're well-equipped to maintain a secure and organized cloud environment.
